# Universal JS app with a React frontend

I found this [tutorial](https://scotch.io/tutorials/react-on-the-server-for-beginners-build-a-universal-react-and-node-app) on scotch.io in preparation for something I'm planning on building. I swapped out Babel preset 2015 for the hot new Babel preset ENV and I'm planning on getting some foundations for some more involved web app building on my horizon.
